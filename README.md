# Pyber Ride Sharing Analysis
## Overview
In this project, we were tasked with examining and interpriting Pyber ride share data using Python to better understand the relationship between fare metrics and types of cities where this technology is available. By creating visuals using Python code in Jupyter Lab we were able to take the large amount of numbers present in this data and translate it into something more digestable and meaningful. With this better understanding of the data, we can determine where our underserved neighborhoods are and work to provide better access in those areas.
